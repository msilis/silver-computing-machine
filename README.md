# React Hangman App

This project is a simple hangman game made with react.

## How the game works

You guess letters to reveal a word. If you guess correctly, you will see the letter appear in the word display.
If you guess incorrectly, you will see the hangman drawing start to take shape.

You have ten tries to guess the word before the hangman is complete.

## UI

To submit a letter you can either press the submit button or hit the enter key.

To reset the hangman game but keep current word, press the reset button.

To reset the game completely, refresh the browser window.

To get help, press the help button and some basic info will pop up.

## Random words

The random words are taken from the Random Word API found here: https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word
